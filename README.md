Module One Final Project
========================

This is a  **Command Line CRUD App** which uses a database to persist information. The CLI uses:

- Ruby
- Object Orientation
- Relationships (via ActiveRecord)
- Problem Solving (via creating a Command Line Interface (CLI))

This app:

1. Contains at least three models with corresponding tables, including a join table.
2. Accesses a Sqlite3 database using ActiveRecord.
3. Has a CLI that allows users to interact with your database as defined by your _user stories_ (minimum of four; one for each CRUD action).
4. Uses OO design patterns and has separate models for the runner and CLI interface.
